## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete pl/John Doe`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete pl/John Doe")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete pl/John Doe` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* `JsonAdaptedPerson` persists player details including primitive fields (`name`, `phone`, `email`, `address`, `isCaptain`) and JSON-adapted components — `JsonAdaptedInjury`, `JsonAdaptedTag`, `JsonAdaptedPosition`, and `JsonAdaptedTeam`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Captain Management Feature

#### Implementation

The captain management feature allows coaches to designate one captain per team and view all captains across teams. It consists of three main commands:
- `assigncaptain pl/PLAYER_NAME` - Assigns a player as captain of their team
- `stripcaptain pl/PLAYER_NAME` - Removes captain status from a player
- `listcaptain` - Lists all players who are captains

The captain status is stored as a boolean field `isCaptain` in the immutable `Person` class. Since `Person` objects are immutable, any change to captain status requires creating a new `Person` object with the updated status.

#### Architecture and Design

The captain management feature follows the standard command architecture:

1. **Command Classes**: `AssignCaptainCommand`, `StripCaptainCommand`, `ListCaptainCommand`
2. **Parser Classes**: `AssignCaptainCommandParser`, `StripCaptainCommandParser` (no parser needed for `ListCaptainCommand`)
3. **Model Methods**: `assignCaptain(Person)`, `stripCaptain(Person)`, `getTeamCaptain(Team)`

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Immutability**: The `Person` class remains immutable. Captain status changes create a new `Person` object.
2. **One Captain Per Team**: When assigning a new captain, any existing captain on that team is automatically stripped of their captaincy.
3. **Idempotent Operations**: Commands can be executed multiple times without causing errors:
   - Assigning captain to someone who's already a captain succeeds silently
   - Stripping captain from someone who's not a captain succeeds silently
4. **Automatic Captain Removal**: When a player changes teams via `assignteam`, their captain status is automatically removed.

#### Sequence Diagram: Assign Captain Command

The following sequence diagram shows how the `assigncaptain pl/Sergio Ramos` command is executed:

```
User -> LogicManager: execute("assigncaptain pl/Sergio Ramos")
LogicManager -> AddressBookParser: parseCommand("assigncaptain pl/Sergio Ramos")
AddressBookParser -> AssignCaptainCommandParser: parse("pl/Sergio Ramos")
AssignCaptainCommandParser --> AddressBookParser: AssignCaptainCommand
AddressBookParser --> LogicManager: AssignCaptainCommand

LogicManager -> AssignCaptainCommand: execute(model)
AssignCaptainCommand -> Model: getPersonByName(Name("Sergio Ramos"))
Model --> AssignCaptainCommand: targetPerson

AssignCaptainCommand -> Model: getTeamCaptain(targetPerson.getTeam())
Model --> AssignCaptainCommand: currentCaptain (or null)

alt currentCaptain exists
    AssignCaptainCommand -> Model: stripCaptain(currentCaptain)
    Model -> UniquePersonList: setPerson(oldPerson, newPersonWithoutCaptaincy)
end

AssignCaptainCommand -> Model: assignCaptain(targetPerson)
Model -> UniquePersonList: setPerson(oldPerson, newPersonWithCaptaincy)
AssignCaptainCommand --> LogicManager: CommandResult
LogicManager --> User: Display success message
```

#### Activity Diagram: Assign Captain Flow

```
Start
→ Parse command
→ Get target person by name
→ [Person exists?]
  No → Throw CommandException (Person not found)
  Yes → Get current captain of person's team
    → [Current captain exists?]
      Yes → Strip captain from current captain
            → Notify user about stripped captain
      No → Continue
    → Assign captain to target person
    → Return success message
→ End
```

#### Implementation Details

**Model Level (`ModelManager.java`):**

```java
@Override
public void assignCaptain(Person person) {
    Person updatedPerson = new Person(
        person.getName(),
        person.getPhone(),
        person.getEmail(),
        person.getAddress(),
        person.getTeam(),
        person.getTags(),
        person.getPosition(),
        person.getInjuries(),
        true  // Set captain status to true
    );
    setPerson(person, updatedPerson);
}

@Override
public void stripCaptain(Person person) {
    Person updatedPerson = new Person(
        person.getName(),
        // ... other fields
        Person.DEFAULT_CAPTAIN_STATUS  // Set to false
    );
    setPerson(person, updatedPerson);
}

@Override
public Person getTeamCaptain(Team team) {
    requireNonNull(team);
    return addressBook.getPersonList().stream()
        .filter(person -> person.getTeam().equals(team) && person.isCaptain())
        .findFirst()
        .orElse(null);
}
```

**Command Level (`AssignCaptainCommand.java`):**

The command enforces the one-captain-per-team rule by checking for existing captains before assignment:

```java
@Override
public CommandResult execute(Model model) throws CommandException {
    Person targetPerson = model.getPersonByName(targetName);
    
    Person currentCaptain = model.getTeamCaptain(targetPerson.getTeam());
    String resultMessage = "";
    
    if (currentCaptain != null) {
        model.stripCaptain(currentCaptain);
        resultMessage = String.format(MESSAGE_STRIPPED_PREVIOUS_CAPTAIN, 
                                     currentCaptain.getName());
    }
    
    model.assignCaptain(targetPerson);
    resultMessage += String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, 
                                   targetPerson.getName(), 
                                   targetPerson.getTeam().getName());
    return CommandResult.showPersonCommandResult(resultMessage);
}
```

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Handling Multiple Captain Assignments**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Automatically strip the old captain when assigning a new one.
  * Pros: Enforces one-captain-per-team rule automatically, better user experience (no need to manually strip first)
  * Cons: User might not notice the old captain was stripped if they don't read the message carefully
  
* **Alternative 2:** Throw an error if a captain already exists.
  * Pros: Forces explicit action from the user, prevents accidental captain changes
  * Cons: Requires two commands for changing captains (strip then assign), more cumbersome workflow

**Aspect: Idempotent Behavior**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Commands succeed even if the state is already as desired.
  * Pros: More forgiving user experience, prevents errors from repeated commands
  * Cons: User might not realize the command had no effect
  
* **Alternative 2:** Throw errors for redundant operations.
  * Pros: Provides immediate feedback about the current state
  * Cons: Frustrating user experience when commands fail for benign reasons

**Aspect: Captain Status During Team Reassignment**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Automatically remove captain status when player changes teams.
  * Pros: Prevents orphaned captain status, maintains data integrity
  * Cons: User loses captain status even if moving to a team without a captain
  
* **Alternative 2:** Retain captain status when changing teams.
  * Pros: Preserves captain designation
  * Cons: Could result in multiple captains per team if not carefully managed

#### Test Cases

The captain management feature is tested through comprehensive unit tests that verify both command execution and edge cases.

**`AssignCaptainCommandTest.java`**

| Test Case | Purpose | Verification |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `execute_personExistsAndNotCaptain_marksAsCaptain` | Verify assigning captain to a non-captain player | Checks that command returns success message with player name and team |
| `execute_personDoesNotExist_throwsCommandException` | Verify error handling for non-existent player | Checks that `CommandException` is thrown with appropriate error message |
| `execute_teamAlreadyHasCaptain_stripsOldCaptainAndMakesNewCaptain` | Verify one-captain-per-team enforcement | Checks that old captain is stripped and new captain is assigned, with both messages in result |
| `equals` | Verify command equality | Tests `equals()` method for same object, same values, null, different types, and different names |

**Key Testing Patterns:**

1. **ModelStub Usage**: Tests use `ModelStub` to isolate command logic from the full model implementation
2. **Idempotent Behavior**: Tests verify commands succeed even when state is already desired (no exception thrown)
3. **Message Verification**: Tests check exact success messages returned by commands
4. **Immutability**: Tests do not check state of original `Person` objects, only command results

**`StripCaptainCommandTest.java`**

| Test Case | Purpose | Verification |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `execute_personExistsAndIsCaptain_stripsCaptaincy` | Verify removing captain status from a captain | Checks that command returns success message |
| `execute_personDoesNotExist_throwsCommandException` | Verify error handling for non-existent player | Checks that `CommandException` is thrown with appropriate error message |
| `equals` | Verify command equality | Tests `equals()` method for same object, same values, null, different types, and different names |

**`ListCaptainCommandTest.java`**

| Test Case | Purpose | Verification |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `execute_listCaptain_showsCaptainsOnly` | Verify filtering shows only captains | Checks that `PREDICATE_SHOW_CAPTAINS` is applied to model |
| `execute_listCaptain_success` | Verify success message | Checks that correct success message is returned |

**Example Test Implementation:**

```java
@Test
public void execute_teamAlreadyHasCaptain_stripsOldCaptainAndMakesNewCaptain() throws Exception {
    Person oldCaptain = new PersonBuilder().withName("Old Captain").withCaptain(true).build();
    Person newCaptain = new PersonBuilder().withName("New Captain").withCaptain(false).build();
    Name newCaptainName = newCaptain.getName();

    ModelStub modelStub = new ModelStub() {
        private boolean oldCaptainStripped = false;

        @Override
        public Person getPersonByName(Name queryName) {
            if (queryName.equals(newCaptainName)) {
                return newCaptain;
            }
            throw new PersonNotFoundException();
        }

        @Override
        public Person getTeamCaptain(seedu.address.model.team.Team team) {
            return oldCaptainStripped ? null : oldCaptain;
        }

        @Override
        public void stripCaptain(Person person) {
            if (person.equals(oldCaptain)) {
                oldCaptainStripped = true;
            }
        }

        @Override
        public void assignCaptain(Person person) {
            // Captain assignment handled by command
        }
    };

    AssignCaptainCommand command = new AssignCaptainCommand(newCaptainName);
    CommandResult result = command.execute(modelStub);

    // Verify message mentions both stripping and assigning
    String expectedMessage = String.format(AssignCaptainCommand.MESSAGE_STRIPPED_PREVIOUS_CAPTAIN,
            oldCaptain.getName())
            + String.format(AssignCaptainCommand.MESSAGE_SUCCESS,
            newCaptain.getName(), newCaptain.getTeam().getName());
    assertEquals(CommandResult.showPersonCommandResult(expectedMessage), result);
}
```

**Testing Philosophy:**

- **Immutability Preservation**: Tests respect `Person` immutability by not checking original object state
- **Idempotent Operations**: No exceptions thrown for redundant operations (e.g., assigning captain to existing captain)
- **One Captain Per Team**: Tests verify automatic stripping of old captain when assigning new one
- **Clear Error Messages**: Tests verify specific, helpful error messages for failure cases

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 football players without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Should be packaged into a single JAR file such that no additional installation steps are required.
5.  Should work fully offline and must not depend on any custom remote server for normal operations.
6.  User data should be stored locally in a human editable JSON file, without using a DBMS.
7.  GUI should render optimally at 1920x1080 and above (for 100% & 125% scaling) and remain fully functional at 1280x720 and above (for 150% scaling) on any _mainstream OS_.
8.  Response to any single user command should be visible within 3 seconds on any _mainstream OS_.
9.  User interface should be intuitive for football coaches with limited technical background to complete core tasks after reading the user guide once.
10. Sensitive player data should be safeguarded against accidental disclosure via manual export and delete options, and by running the app in a secure environment where local files are protected by the device's password.
