# PlayBook User Guide

PlayBook (PB) is a **desktop app for semi-professional youth football coaches to manage their players' contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PB can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your PlayBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar playbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all players.
   
   * `addteam tm/u16`: Adds a team named `u16` to the PlayBook.

   * `add pl/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 tm/u16` : Adds a player named `John Doe` to the PlayBook (make sure to add the team `u16` first).

   * `newposition ps/LW` : Creates a new position named `LW` (Left Wing) in the PlayBook.

   * `assignposition pl/John Doe ps/LW` : Assigns the position `LW` to `John Doe` in the PlayBook.

   * `assigninjury pl/John Doe i/ACL` : Assigns an injury status of `ACL` to `John Doe` from the PlayBook. 

   * `delete pl/John Doe` : Deletes `John Doe` from the PlayBook.

   * `clear` : Deletes all players' contacts and teams from the PlayBook.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add pl/PLAYER_NAME`, `PLAYER_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add pl/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  - e.g `pl/PLAYER_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `pl/John Doe t/friend` or as `pl/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `pl/PLAYER_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER pl/PLAYER_NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

When you use `filtercaptains`, all captains across all teams will be listed, including multiple captains from the same team. This feature gives you the flexibility to structure team leadership in the way that best suits your coaching philosophy and team dynamics.

**Example scenario:**
- Assign John Doe as captain of U16 team: `makecaptain pl/John Doe`
- Assign Jane Smith as another captain of U16 team: `makecaptain pl/Jane Smith`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, PlayBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the PlayBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous PlayBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
